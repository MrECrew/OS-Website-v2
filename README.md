# OS-Website-v2
The 2nd version of the Objection Studios Website, as normal released before a revamp with all personal info removed. Also this time its the whole thing!
Our previous site lasted from ~20th of may 2022 to 2nd of September 2022.

### Why do we have this?
When making this although its not the best I want to let other people learn from it, wether its noticing a problem in my code they can suggest a fix for or even to take small amounts to try themselfs.

### What is on here?
Some of the code from our website (objectionstudios.com) is here, it could be an entire page to how we made a box on it. Small bits the community can help us with or we can help the community with.

### Is this updated?
Yes as of 2nd September is repository is updated with nee things from time to time.

### Is that all?
No! This may also get update logs or developer comments on things. Sometimes even how we plan some pages and things like that.

### How can YOU make a change?
If you notice a bug or a really ineffient way of doing something and you can help, either do a GitHub bug thing or email us! We also have a discord on our website you can join and message us from too.
